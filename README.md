# Bike-Sharing System Inventory Rebalancing

## Introduction

This project is inspired by the research [Inventory rebalancing and vehicle routing in bike sharing systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221716306658), which is a New York Citi bike project. I turned the mathimatical method into python code and tried to utilize it into Taipei youbike to solve the inventory rebalancing problem.

## Dataset

The data I used is sourced from the Department of Transportation, Taipei City Government, and includes historical records of stations, transaction records, and dispatcher operation records. The dataset covers all stations in Taipei City from May to August 2024.
